A PVP gamemode where players fight each other with custom classes with special abilities (or "Quirks") based on My Hero Academia. 

There are multiple different modes in planning, such as 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, FFA, and Heroes VS Villains.

Currently, two quirks are fully developed and the 1v1 mode is fully playable.

Dependencies:

[Mine] HerobrinePVP-CORE (Main core. It's the backbone for all my custom plugins within this setup.)
[Mine] GameCore (Lots of minigame-related functions, configuration settings, and arena management. It's the backbone for all my minigame plugins within this setup.)
[Forked] NoteBlockAPI (HBPVP-Core Dependency for playing custom NoteBlock themes - i.e win/draw/lose jingles, and even custom soundtracks)

Design Doc (Being updated as the design evolves): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yxL2iu_Sn1XQJ-Y1-37pz-hk-nA9N_6OHKiqB0K0RHo/edit?usp=sharing

Quirk Battles uses GameCore's class system, which allows you to develop customized classes for each game. 
A quick version of the game has already been spun up, allowing you to 1v1 with two quirks - One For All and Explosion.
A refactor is currently in progress which will make the abilities for Quirks work similar to [DeltaCraft](https://github.com/HerobrineGamesYT/DeltaCraft) Item Abilities. 
The current stats system in Quirk Battles works just like it does in Deltacraft, with a custom PlayerStats class.
A custom noteblock remix of You Say Run from the My Hero Academia OST has been created. You can hear it in the background of all of the gameplay clips.

Currently Developed Quirks:

  One For All: 
  
  Basic Demonstration: https://streamable.com/77ix9v
  
  Base Damage:  4 + (4*power)
 
  Health: 250
 
  Defense: 50
  
  Hold Right Click to power up. Your movement speed increases while powering up.
  Your power will reset with every attack.

  Abilities:

  Detroit Smash: Launches the player up, then pushes them back down towards the direction they are looking. Nearby players in a 2 block radius are damaged when you land on the ground.
   
    Damage: 15 + (15*power)
    Cooldown: 15s

  Shoot Style: Launch the player slightly up, and then forwards in direction they are looking to do a "kick". Any players within a small radius of the attack trajectory are damaged.
   
    Damage: 20 + (20*power)
    Cooldown: 25s
    
  Air Propulsion: Launch the player in the direction they are looking with x propulsion strength.
   
    Propulsion Strength: 2 + (2*power)
    Cooldown: 1.2s

  Every time a One For All player attacks, a random chance is rolled based on their current power-up percentage. 
  If it hits, then the player will take damage based on that. 
  OFA Damage Calculation: 10 + (10*Power)

  For example, if a player does a Shoot Style attack at 30%, and the game decides they should get hurt, the player will take 13 damage.
  Suppose the player decided to attack at 100%. In that case, the player will be GUARANTEED to take 20 damage, which could be devastating depending on how the fight is going- but it could be worth sacrificing your HP for a full-power attack in some situations.

  Note: The self-damage still goes under the damage reduction calculation from the player's defense.


  Explosion:
